Magical Creature Pet Simulator
Welcome to our team's submission for the Digital Pet Python OOP Challenge! This project implements a virtual pet simulator using Object-Oriented Programming in Python, featuring a fantasy theme where pets are magical creatures with elemental powers (Fire, Water, Earth, Air). The code fulfills all required features (attributes, methods, bonus tricks) and includes creative additions like a mood system, elemental quests, and emoji-enhanced outputs for an engaging experience.
Project Overview
The Pet class creates a magical creature with a name, elemental type, and attributes (hunger, energy, happiness). Pets can eat, sleep, play, learn tricks, and undertake epic quests tailored to their element (e.g., Fire pets battle phoenixes, Water pets explore sunken temples). A mood system reflects their emotional state, and emojis add vibrancy to interactions.
Key Features
Elemental Types: Pets are Fire, Water, Earth, or Air creatures, each with unique actions and flavor text.

Mood System: Displays mood (Ecstatic, Cheerful, Grumpy, Miserable) based on hunger, energy, and happiness.

Quest System: Pets embark on adventures if they have sufficient energy and happiness, earning quest completions.

Emoji Outputs: Actions and status reports include simple emojis (e.g., :bone:, :sparkles:) for fun and clarity.

Bonus Tricks: train() and show_tricks() methods manage tricks, preventing duplicates.

Robust Design: Handles edge cases (stat limits, low energy, duplicate tricks) with clear feedback.

Project Structure
pet.py: Contains the Pet class with detailed comments.

main.py: Tests the class with two pets, demonstrating all features and edge cases.

README.md: This file, providing setup, usage, and feature details.

Setup and Running
Requirements
Python 3.x (uses only the standard random module).

Instructions
Clone or Download:
Clone: git clone <repository-url>

Or download and extract the project folder.

Navigate to the Directory:
bash

cd <project-folder>

Run the Test Script:
bash

python main.py

Expected Output:
Creates two pets: "Flare" (Fire) and "Aqua" (Water).

Tests eating, playing, sleeping, training, quests, and status display.

Shows edge cases (e.g., low energy preventing quests).

Displays emoji-enhanced messages and status reports.

Example Usage
In main.py:
python

from pet import Pet

# Create pets
dragon = Pet("Flare", "Fire")
mermaid = Pet("Aqua", "Water")

# Test Flare
dragon.eat()
dragon.play()
dragon.train("flame spin")
dragon.go_on_quest()
dragon.get_status()

# Test Aqua
mermaid.play()
mermaid.eat()
mermaid.go_on_quest()
mermaid.energy = 1
mermaid.go_on_quest()  # Should fail

Sample Output

=== Creating Magical Pets ===
:sparkles: A magical Fire creature named Flare has joined you! :sparkles:
:sparkles: A magical Water creature named Aqua has joined you! :sparkles:

=== Testing Flare the Fire Creature ===
Flare munches on :fire: Spicy Ember Berries! :bone: Hunger down, happiness up!
Flare chases flaming comets! :fire: :tada: Happiness up, energy down!
Flare mastered the flame spin trick! :sparkles: Happiness boosted!
Flare battled a rogue phoenix! :world_map: Quest complete! Happiness up, energy down!

:star2: Flare, the Fire Creature :star2:
:apple: Hunger: 3/10
:zap: Energy: 2/10
:smiley_cat: Happiness: 10/10
:brain: Mood: Cheerful :feet:
:dart: Tricks: ['flame spin']
:trophy: Quests Completed: 1

=== Testing Aqua the Water Creature ===
Aqua splashes in enchanted puddles! :droplet: :tada: Happiness up, energy down!
Aqua munches on :droplet: Crystal Kelp! :bone: Hunger down, happiness up!
Aqua explored a sunken temple! :coral: :world_map: Quest complete! Happiness up, energy down!
Aqua needs more energy (3+) or happiness (3+) for a quest! :disappointed:

Note: Quest happiness boosts are random (1–3), so values may vary.
Creative Enhancements
Our team enhanced the project with a fantasy-themed pet universe:
Elemental Types:
Each element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) has unique actions (e.g., Air pets eat "Zephyr Cakes").

Quests align with the element (e.g., Earth pets unearth crystal caves).

Mood System:
Moods are calculated from stats, adding personality (e.g., Cheerful with :feet:).

Quest System:
Requires energy ≥ 3 and happiness ≥ 3; costs energy, increases hunger, boosts happiness.

Tracks completed quests for a sense of achievement.

Emojis:
Uses GitHub-compatible emoji shortcodes (e.g., :fire:, :sparkles:) for consistent rendering.

Code Quality:
Clear comments throughout pet.py.

Robust edge case handling (e.g., stat limits, low energy checks).

Potential Improvements
Add a battle() method for pets to duel using tricks.

Implement a leveling system based on quest completions.

Create a GUI with Tkinter for visual interaction.

Allow pets to team up for group quests.
